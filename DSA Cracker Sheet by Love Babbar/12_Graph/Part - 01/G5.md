## Explanation 

### Initial Configuration:
 1. Queue data structure: 
    - follows FIFO, and will always contain the starting.
 2. Visited array: 
    - an array initialized to 0

   <br> 
   
 ```Step-01:```
   > In BFS, We start with a “starting” node, mark it as visited, and push it into the queue data structure
     
 ```Step-02:```  
   > In every iteration, We pop out the node ‘v’ and put it in the solution vector, as we are traversing this node
        
```Step-03:``` 
   > All the unvisited adjacent nodes from ‘v’ are visited next and are pushed into the queue. 
   > The list of adjacent neighbors of the node can be accessed from the adjacency list.
      
```Step-04:``` 
   > Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the queue becomes empty, 
   > and this way you can easily traverse all the nodes in the graph.
